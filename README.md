# EASC2022

The EASC team consists of 6 students and a teacher from the Athens College High School. This team was created to participate in the "CanSat in Greece" contest. We believe that Open Source projects have a huge impact on the scientific community and thus we created this repository. Here you can access our code, our CAD models and the data that we collect from our missions.
